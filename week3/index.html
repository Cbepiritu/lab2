  <h1 style="color:white;">THE WITCHER 3</h1>
  <p style="color:white;">One interesting fact about witchers is that they have a unique sense of smell that allows them to detect the presence of magic and supernatural entities, 
  which is often useful in their monster hunting profession. This sense is called "Witcher's Sense" or "Witcher's Instinct."</p>
